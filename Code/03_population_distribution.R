file #it will open i vari passaggi per arrivare al pacchetto

#there is a fanction to translate the file to a tipe of file that R can use and it's call 
#spatvector, the fanction is called vect
vect

rana$Occurrence #different point in which i have the frog. occurence = or you have the species or not 

plot(rana) #let's plot

#now let's plot only the data that contain 1
#sequel --> sql from the datasat with 0 and one we want to select only the one with 1, 
#occurrence =1 
#! = it will not equal to

press <- rana[rana$Occurrence==1] #rana is the dataset, the elements #from rana go to occurrence and send all the dataset wher occurence = 1 select all the dataset in line with this condition. this is called press
