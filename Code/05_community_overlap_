data(kerinci)

#EXERCISE, show the first six row of kerici
head(kerinci) #!!!!! first six row
kerinci #the whole thing i guess

summary(kerinci) #to have statistic of every single field

#let's create a new fields that is the time in 
kerinci$Timecirc <- kerinci$Time * 2 * pi #$ to link #we can create a new column or create an object, so we give it a name <- #if you don't connect with $ you just have the new object, if you $connect you have a new column 
head(kerinci) #now if you do this you can also see the circular time 

#creating a new dataset with only the tiger data

head(kerinci) #to see the name of the species that is Sps, i can also do:
names(kerinci)

tiger <- kerinci[kerinci$Sps=='tiger',] #inside the dataset we are only going to select the datasect containing tiger as species. Sps inside kerinci $, should be equal == "name" then , to close the quiry

#tigertime #set the time for the tiger, in the column is called Timecirc
tigertime <- tiger$Timecirc
tigertime

#we can now do a graph about density plot. density plot -> the black line that stay over the top of the graph
densityPlot(tigertime) #important the capital P

#let's do the same with macaque
#EXESCISE select the  data for the macaque in the kerinci set and assigne them to a new object
macque <- kerinci[kerinci$Sps=='macaque',]
head(macaque)

#EXERCISE select the time and make density plot
macaquetime <- macaque$Timecirc
macaquetime

densityPlot(macaquetime)

#now let's overlap the two plot 
overlapPlot(timetig, timemac)
